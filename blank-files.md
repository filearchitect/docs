# Blank files

When the settings `Create functional blank files` is enabled, files will be created as functional files instead of empty files. Meaning that binary files like `.png`, `.psd`, `.pdf`, etc. should be created as minimal working files.

## Replacing files

The files will be downloaded locally in `~/Documents/FileArchitect/BlankFiles`. You can replace the files in this folder to have your own defaults.
